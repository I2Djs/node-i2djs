# What is node-i2djs?

node-i2djs is a node module for rendering canvas based 2D graphics. node-i2djs provides a declarative and virtual Dom based model that helps in efficient rendering. node-i2djs is built on top of the node canvas module. node-i2djs also provides APIs to create and export the content in different media formats like  Images/PDFs.. etc.

# What does it provide?
node-i2djs declarative approach provides an easy way to define different types of geometrical entities, as supported in SVG. It also enables pixel manipulations, multimedia support, PDF creations.. etc

It provides API's to create, access, modify, and delete graphical entities on canvas. Functionalities such as Data Joins (Join-Actions) help in associating/binding data with graphical elements and their manipulations.
The following node-i2djs features helps in achieving efficient and scalable rendering:
  - <b> Declarative Rendering: </b> Simple syntax and semantics by abstracting complex native syntax. Inline with client - I2Djs framework.
  - <b> Virtual DOM tree:</b> node-I2Djs (all contexts) implements a mini Virtual DOM tree, which is a Javascript object representation of the corresponding DOM. Helps in keeping the state intact and enable operations such as update, addition and deletion as per the requirements.
  - <b> Join-Actions(Data Joins):</b> node-i2djs Join-Action mechanism helps in binding the data to the graphical elements by defining the actions - Enter, Update and Exit. It provides flexible handlers to manipulate data and trigger corresponding actions in an optimal way.
  - <b> Multi page PDF / media support:</b> node-i2djs lets u export the content in different media formats. It also provides exclusive apis to create multi page graphical PDFs.
